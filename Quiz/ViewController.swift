    func animateLabelTransitions() {

If we do not call this before the rest of the method, we will get some perhaps unintended consequences. In this case, we will also animate the size of the labels, so we will see the labels animate their re-sizing. You can see this happen if you delete this method call on view and run this app in the simulator with animations slowed (Command-T). The labels will animate their re-sizing. Not noticeable at full speed, but an unintended side-effect none-the-less that could muck up a more complex animation if not careful.
